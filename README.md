The dataset of robot calibration
This position data of HSR JR680 robot can be used for robot calibration. We provide PANNCali.xlsx with 510 sample points of HSR robot, which can be used for the verification of manipulator calibration algorithm. Here, L is the length of the cable, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 are the joint angles of the robot.
